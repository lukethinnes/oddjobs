## Description

Everybody needs a little help sometimes. Likewise, a lot of people find themselves in a position where they're down on their luck and wish they could pick up a couple shifts in a field of their qualifications. OddJobs seeks to eliminate the barriers between these two and enable individuals to connect with one another to make life run more smoothly for one and all.

## Technologies

- React Native
- Material UI
- Lottie

## Setup and Activation

Run "npm start" in both the front and backend directories in order to activate. You can then use Expo to run the application on mobile.

## Inspiration

I spent years in various manual labor fields working beneath subcontractors and organizations. Being in such an intense field made me wish at times that the schedule could be a bit more flexible and that there could be a way to arrange this and also build community. It seems like Craigslist had the potential to become something close to this before being hijacked by scammers. I hope this application can one day bring joy to many!
